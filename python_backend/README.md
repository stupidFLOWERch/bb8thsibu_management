# Uniform Manual AI Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that provides accurate answers from the Uniform Manual by combining semantic search, reranking, and large language models.

## Features

- **Semantic Search** – Uses ChromaDB with `text-embedding-3-small` for vector-based retrieval.
- **Dual-Query Retrieval** – Executes two separate searches (current and historical context) to prevent topic pollution.
- **BGE Reranker** – Employs `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` Cross-Encoder for precision re-ranking.
- **Conversation Memory** – Maintains the last three exchanges to handle follow-up questions.
- **Follow-up Detection** – Detects user follow-up queries using pattern matching, word count, and keyword overlap.
- **Gemini LLM** – Generates concise answers using `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`.
